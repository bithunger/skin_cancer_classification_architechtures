# Skin Cancer Classification Architectures

Welcome to the `skin_cancer_classification_architectures` repository. This project explores various deep learning architectures like InceptionV3, InceptionResnetV2, MultiNet, and Xception tailored for the detection and classification of skin cancer.

## Data
The models in this repository are trained on the [Skin Cancer MNIST: HAM10000 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hasnainjaved/melanoma-skin-cancer-dataset-of-10000-images). This dataset is a large collection of multi-source dermatoscopic images of common pigmented skin lesions.

### Data Description

- **Number of images:** Over 10,000
- **Image Type:** Dermatoscopic
- **Labels:** 2 different categories including Melanoma, Benign
- **Data Source:** [Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hasnainjaved/melanoma-skin-cancer-dataset-of-10000-images)
